     NAME
          fclose, fflush - close or flush a stream

     SYNTAX
          #include <stdio.h>

          int fclose (stream)
          FILE *stream;

          int fflush (stream)
          FILE *stream;

     DESCRIPTION
          Fclose causes any buffered data for the named stream to be
          written out, and the stream to be closed.

          Fclose is performed automatically for all open files upon
          calling exit().

          Fflush causes any buffered data for the named stream to be
          written to that file.  The stream remains open.

     DIAGNOSTICS
          These functions return 0 for success, and EOF if any error
          (such as trying to write to a file that has not been opened
          for writing) was detected.

     SEE ALSO
          close.m, exit.m, fopen.m, setbuf.m
