NAME
       ident - identify files

SYNOPSIS
       ident [ -q ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       ident   searches   for  all  occurrences  of  the  pattern
       $keyword:...$ in the named  files  or,  if  no  file  name
       appears, the standard input.

       These  patterns are normally inserted automatically by the
       RCS command co,  but can  also  be inserted manually.  The
       option  -q  suppresses  the  warning given if there are no
       patterns in a file.

       ident works on text files as  well  as  object  files  and
       dumps.  For example, if the C program in f.c contains

              char  rcsid[] = "$Id: f.c,v 5.0 1990/08/22 09:09:36
              eggert Exp $";

       and f.c is compiled into f.o, then the command

              ident  f.c  f.o

       will output

              f.c:
                  $Id: f.c,v 5.0 1990/08/22 09:09:36 eggert Exp $
              f.o:
                  $Id: f.c,v 5.0 1990/08/22 09:09:36 eggert Exp $
