NAME
       rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
       rcsmerge [options] file

DESCRIPTION
       rcsmerge incorporates the changes between two revisions of
       an RCS file into the corresponding working file.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in ci.m.

       At least one revision must be specified with  one  of  the
       options  described  below,  usually -r.  At most two revi-
       sions may be specified.  If only one  revision  is  speci-
       fied,  the latest revision on the default branch (normally
       the highest branch on the trunk) is assumed for the second
       revision.   Revisions may be specified numerically or sym-
       bolically.

       rcsmerge prints a  warning  if  there  are  overlaps,  and
       delimits the overlapping regions as explained in  merge.m.
       The command is useful for  incorporating  changes  into  a
       checked-out revision.

OPTIONS
       -ksubst
              Use  subst  style  keyword substitution.   See co.m
              for details.  For example, -kk -r1.1 -r1.2  ignores
              differences  in  keyword  values  when  merging the
              changes from 1.1 to 1.2.

       -p[rev]
              Send the result to standard output instead of over-
              writing the working file.

       -q[rev]
              Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

       -r[rev]
              Merge  with respect to revision rev.  Here an empty
              rev stands for the latest revision on  the  default
              branch, normally the head.

       -Vn    Emulate RCS version n.  See co.m for details.

       -xsuffixes
              Use  suffixes to characterize RCS files.   See ci.m
              for details.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose you have released revision  2.8  of  f.c.   Assume
       furthermore that after you complete an unreleased revision
       3.4, you receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.
       To combine the updates to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8
       and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

           rcsmerge  -p  -r2.8  -r3.4  f.c  >f.merged.c

       Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if  you  want  to
       save  the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as
       revision 2.8.1.1 and execute co -j:

           ci  -r2.8.1.1  f.c
           co  -r3.4  -j2.8:2.8.1.1  f.c

       As another  example,  the  following  command  undoes  the
       changes  between  revision  2.4  and 2.8 in your currently
       checked out revision in f.c.

           rcsmerge  -r2.8  -r2.4  f.c

       Note the order of the arguments,  and  that  f.c  will  be
       overwritten.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 for no overlaps, 1 for some  overlaps,  2
       for trouble.
