RLOG(1)                                                   RLOG(1)


NAME
       rlog  - print log messages and other information about RCS
       files

SYNOPSIS
       rlog [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       rlog prints information about RCS files.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in ci.m.

       rlog prints the following information for each  RCS  file:
       RCS  pathname, working pathname, head (i.e., the number of
       the latest revision on the trunk), default branch,  access
       list, locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of revi-
       sions, number of  revisions  selected  for  printing,  and
       descriptive  text.   This  is  followed by entries for the
       selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each
       branch.   For  each revision, rlog prints revision number,
       author, date/time, state, number  of  lines  added/deleted
       (with  respect  to  the  previous revision), locker of the
       revision (if any), and log message.  All  times  are  dis-
       played  in  Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).   Without
       options, rlog prints complete  information.   The  options
       below restrict this output.

       -L  Ignore RCS files that have no locks set.  This is con-
           venient in combination with -h, -p, and -O.

       -O  Print only the name of the RCS file.  This  is  conve-
           nient  for  translating a working pathname into an RCS
           pathname.

       -h  Print only the RCS pathname, working  pathname,  head,
           default  branch,  access  list, locks, symbolic names,
           and suffix.

       -t  Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.

       -b  Print information about the revisions on  the  default
           branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

       -ddates
           Print  information  about  revisions  with  a  checkin
           date/time  in  the  ranges  given  by  the  semicolon-
           separated list of dates.  A range of the form d1<d2 or
           d2>d1  selects  the  revisions  that  were   deposited
           between  d1  and d2 inclusive.  A range of the form <d
           or d> selects all revisions dated  d  or  earlier.   A
           range of the form d< or >d selects all revisions dated
           d or later.  A range of the form d selects the single,
           latest  revision  dated  d  or earlier.  The date/time
           strings d, d1, and d2 are in the free format explained
           in  co(1).   Quoting is normally necessary, especially
           for < and >.  Note that the separator is a  semicolon.

       -p[lockers]
           Print  information  about  locked  revisions only.  In
           addition, if the comma-separated list lockers of login
           names is given, ignore all locks other than those held
           by the lockers.  For  example,  rlog -L -O -pjohn  *_v
           prints the name of RCS files locked by the user john.

       -r[revisions]
           prints information about revisions given in the comma-
           separated list revisions of revisions and  ranges.   A
           range  rev1:rev2  means  revisions rev1 to rev2 on the
           same branch, :rev means revisions from  the  beginning
           of  the branch up to and including rev, and rev: means
           revisions starting with rev to the end of  the  branch
           containing  rev.   An  argument that is a branch means
           all revisions on that branch.   A  range  of  branches
           means  all revisions on the branches in that range.  A
           branch followed by a . means the  latest  revision  in
           that  branch.   A  bare -r with no revisions means the
           latest revision on the default  branch,  normally  the
           trunk.

       -sstates
           prints   information   about   revisions  whose  state
           attributes match one of the states given in the comma-
           separated list states.

       -w[logins]
           prints information about revisions checked in by users
           with login names appearing in the comma-separated list
           logins.   If  logins  is  omitted, the user's login is
           assumed.

       -Vn Emulate RCS version n when generating logs.   See co.m
           for more.

       -xsuffixes
           Use suffixes to characterize RCS files.  See ci.m  for
           details.

       rlog prints the intersection  of  the  revisions  selected
       with  the options -d, -p, -s, and -w, intersected with the
       union of the revisions selected by -b and -r.

EXAMPLES
           rlog  -L  -R  *_v
           rlog  -L  -h  *_v
           rlog  -L  -l  *_v
           rlog  *_v

       The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
       subdirectory  RCS  that  have  locks.   The second command
       prints the headers of those files, and  the  third  prints
       the headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions.
       The last command prints complete information.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
       successful.

BUGS
       The separator for revision ranges in the -r option used to
       be - instead of :, but this leads to confusion  when  sym-
       bolic  names  contain -.  For backwards compatibility rlog
       -r still supports the old - separator, but it warns  about
       this obsolete use.
