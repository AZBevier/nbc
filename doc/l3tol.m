     NAME
          l3tol, ltol3 - convert between 3-byte integers and long
          integers

     SYNTAX
          void l3tol (lp, cp, n)
          long *lp;
          char *cp;
          int n;

          void ltol3 (cp, lp, n)
          char *cp;
          long *lp;
          int n;

     DESCRIPTION
          L3tol converts a list of n three-byte integers packed into a
          character string pointed to by cp into a list of long
          integers pointed to by lp.

          Ltol3 performs the reverse conversion from long integers
          (lp) to three-byte integers (cp).

          These functions are useful for file-system maintenance where
          the block numbers are three bytes long.

     SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
          Because of possible differences in byte ordering, the
          numerical values of the long integers are machine-dependent.
