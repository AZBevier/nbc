     NAME
          hypot - Euclidean distance function

     SYNTAX
          #include <math.h>

          double hypot (x, y)
          double x, y;

     DESCRIPTION
          Hypot returns

               sqrt(x * x + y * y),

          taking precautions against unwarranted overflows.

     DIAGNOSTICS
          When the correct value would overflow, hypot returns HUGE
          and sets errno to ERANGE.

          These error-handling procedures may be changed with the
          function matherr().
