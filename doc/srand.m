     NAME
          rand, srand - simple random-number generator

     SYNTAX
          int rand ( )

          void srand (seed)
          unsigned seed;

     DESCRIPTION
          Rand uses a multiplicative congruential random-number
          generator with period 2^32 that returns successive pseudo-
          random numbers in the range from 0 to 2^15-1.

          Srand can be called at any time to reset the random-number
          generator to a random starting point.  The generator is
          initially seeded with a value of 1.

     NOTE
          The spectral properties of rand leave a great deal to be
          desired.  Drand48() provides a much better, though more
          elaborate, random-number generator.
