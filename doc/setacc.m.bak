     NAME
          umask, setsiz, setacc, getacc - set and get file creation
          mask and set default file creation size.

     SYNTAX
          int umask (cmask)
          int cmask;

          int setsiz (start, mini, maxi)
          int start, mini, maxi;

          int setacc (owner, group, other)
          int owner, group, other;

          int * getacc (filename)
          char * filename;

     DESCRIPTION
          Umask is not supported on MPX.  It has been replaced with
          MPX specific functions.

          Setsiz sets the default file creation parameters of MPX
          files.  For MPX 2.X and 3.X, the defaults of zero are
          used for starting size, minimum increment, and maximum
          increment.  For MPX 1.X, the default starting size is
          100 sectors.  The minimum and maximum increments are not
          used.  The specified values remain in effect for all created
          files until changed.

          Setacc sets the MPX access rights for file creation.  The
          default is all rights; i.e., R, W, M, U, A, and D.  The
          specified values remain in effect for all created files
          until changed.

          Getacc will return a pointer to the access rights in the
          resource descriptor for the specified file.  The bits will
          be in bits 0-11 of each word as specified in the MPX 3.X
          technical manual.  For MPX 1.X systems, a pointer to the
          default access rights is returned.  The bits will be in
          bits 26-31 of each word.

     RETURN VALUE
          A value of zero is returned for setsiz and setacc.  For
          getacc, a -1 is returned if the specified file is not
          found, else a pointer to a three word array is returned.
