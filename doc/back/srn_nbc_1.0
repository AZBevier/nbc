3 PRODUCT INFORMATION
____________________________________________________________


About the MPX-32 C Compiler

    The MPX-32 Non-base C compiler operates in one or two pass
    mode.  It generates assembler language instructions which can
    optionally have the source C code intermixed as comments.
    Compile time options allow support for register to register 
    floating point instructions or only register to memory 
    instructions to support 32/7X and 32/27 systems.  The debug
    option allows symbols to be passed through to the Cataloger
    for display with the task debugger.

    The C run-time library provides an emulated UNIX System V
    interface to MPX-32.  Most of the standard library functions
    are provided where emulation was possible without O/S
    modifications.  Functions are also provided to directly access
    MPX-32 SVC's where UNIX compatibility is not desired.  MPX-32
    SVC's can also be called as in-line assembler instructions.
    An additional option also allows non-sectioned code to be
    generated.  This allows functions written in C to be SYSGENed
    into the MPX-32 operating system.

    The MPX-32 Non-base C compiler executes on Encore's SERIES 32/7X,
    CONCEPT32, and RSX computers.  MPX-32 Operating System Version
    1.X (1.4 and later, including EPX 1.X), MPX-32 Version 2.x, and 
    MPX-32 Version 3.x are supported.

      or
    TSM>^(bin)cat /system/doc/xxx.m

    This will display the selected documentation file.

    The SAMPLE directory should be reviewed and the source
    code for the sample programs reviewed to see some of
    the capabilities of the MPX-32 C Compiler.  The mak.samp
    TSM macro should be run to see if the compiler operates
    properly on your system.  The programs CAT and FIXER
    can be cataloged using the TSM macro NBLD as follows:

    TSM>NBLD cat catmap

    This will build the program CAT in the local directory.

    TSM>NBLD fixer fixermap

    This will build the program FIXER in the local directory.


6 PRODUCT HINTS
____________________________________________________________


General Hints

    The NBLD macro should be modified when several programs
    are to be combined to form a load module.  Add the names
    of the object files that are to include after the COMPRESS
    directive.  This will combine all of the non-runtime
    library objects for cataloging.

    The default startup code is C.SRTE.O.  It allocates the
    stack and I/O area in extended memory starting at 0x80000.
    The program will be started in extended mode.  If it is
    desirable to run in non-extended mode, the object module
    C.SRT.O should be included to allow the program to startup
    in non-extended mode.  This would usually be the case when
    interfacing to Fortran subroutines.

    The source code for C.SRT.C and C.SRTE.C are included.
    These are the non-extended and extended mode versions of
    the startup code.  They assume a 12KW stack.  If a larger
    or smaller stack is desired, modify these programs for
    your specific needs.

    The source code for FCALL.S is also included.  Due to
    variations in Fortran calling conventions, it may be
    necessary to modify this interface subroutine.

    The C runtime library is implemented using the UNIX System
    V interface.  Consult any System V reference manual for
    calling conventions.  Also, review the include files in
    the NBINCLUDE directory.

    The preprocessor, NBCPP, searches both the NBINCLUDE and
    CINCLUDE directories for include files.  If an earlier
    version of the MPX-32 C Compiler has been installed, it
    used the CINCLUDE directory for include files.  Make
    sure the CINCLUDE directory is empty or does not contain
    any old outdated include files.  See NBCPP.M in the DOC
    directory.

    The load module, NBYACC, is include with the C Compiler
    as an unsupported utility.  It may or may not be removed
    in future releases of this product.  No Problem Reports
    (PR's) will be accepted for this utility.

    The MPX-32 C Compiler and Runtime library are compatible
    with TXPM.  They will run as TXPM tasks with any problems.


7 KNOWN PROBLEMS
____________________________________________________________


List of Current Problems

    The one pass version of the MPX-32 C Compiler, NBCCOM, is
    quite large and may not run on systems with limited task
    execution space.  If this is the case, use the -2 option
    to NBCC to invoke the two pass version of the compiler.

    There is minimal documentation.

8 PROBLEM REPORT SUMMARY
____________________________________________________________


Introduction

    You can check on the status of any MPX-32 software Problem
    Report (PR) by logging on to a system at Encore Computer
    Corporation in Fort Lauderdale. This procedure is discussed
    in the section, ONLINE VIEWING OF PRs.

    To learn how to report new problems with the MPX-32 C 
    Compiler, Revision 1.0.0, software and documents, refer to
    the section, PROBLEM REPORTING.

    There are no outstanding PRs for the Revision 1.0.0 of
    the MPX-32 C Compiler.


Online Viewing of Problem Reports

    Encore Computer Corporation Customer Services maintains
    an problem-report database for Service Program customers.
    If you are a Service Program customer, use a modem to
    log on to a UTX/32 system at Encore Computer Corporation
    in Fort Lauderdale. Dial (305) 797-5837 and log in as cstspr.
    Be sure the modem is set to:

    + 1200 baud

    + Full duplex

    + 8-bit characters

    + One stop bit

    + No parity


    Call 1-800-TECHAID to report any difficulties with the
    online database.


Problem Reporting

    There are two ways to report problems with the MPX-32 C
    Compiler, Revision 1.0.0, software and documentation.

    + call the toll-free telephone number

    + fill out a PR form.


    The following sections give more information on the use
    of these methods.

By Telephone

    To report a software or documentation problem by telephone,
    within the USA., call a customer service representative at
    1-800-TECHAID. You will be asked to provide the following
    information:

    + The call number (if this is a follow-up call)

    + Your name

    + Company name

    + Contract number

    + System number

    + Telephone number

    + Machine type

    + Operating system and revision number

    + Product and revision number

    + Problem description


    If possible, have an auto-answer modem connected to the
    appropriate MPX/32 system. Customer Services personnel
    should then be able to provide remote hardware or
    software support.


With PR Forms

    A software or documentation problem can be reported by
    filling out a PR form and sending the form with the
    appropriate supplemental information to the address
    indicated on the form.  Forms may be obtained from your
    local Encore Computer Corporation office.
