3 PRODUCT INFORMATION
____________________________________________________________


About the MPX-32 C Compiler

     The MPX-32 Non-base C compiler operates in one or two pass
     mode.   It generates assembler language instructions which
     can optionally  have  the  source  C  code  intermixed  as
     comments.  Compile time options allow support for register
     to register  floating point  instructions or only register
     to memory instructions to support 32/7X and 32/27 systems.
     The debug  option allows  symbols to  be passed through to
     the Cataloger for display with the task debugger.

     The C  run-time library provides an emulated UNIX System V
     interface  to  MPX-32.    Most  of  the  standard  library
     functions  are   provided  where  emulation  was  possible
     without O/S modifications.  Functions are also provided to
     directly access  MPX-32 SVCs  where UNIX  compatibility is
     not desired.   MPX-32  SVC's can also be called as in-line
     assembler instructions.   An additional option also allows
     non-sectioned code to be generated.  This allows functions
     written in  C to  be SYSGENed  into the  MPX-32  operating
     system.

     The MPX-32 Non-base C compiler executes on Encore's SERIES
     32/7X, CONCEPT32,  and RSX  computers.   MPX-32  Operating
     System Revision  1.X (1.4  and later,  including EPX 1.X),
     MPX-32  Revision   2.x,  and   MPX-32  Revision   3.x  are
     supported.

           processing:
    
           One TSM terminal (with lower-case capability).
    
     3.    Adequate disk space (see Disk Space section).


Software Requirements


     The following operating system:

          1401 MPX-32 Operating System Revision 1.X (MPX-32 1.4
          or later).

     The following product installed on that system:

     or execution of the MPX-32 C Compiler:

          FILEMGR
          COMPRESS
          LIBED
          CATALOG


5 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
____________________________________________________________


Binary Installation

     To install  the MPX-32  C Compiler,  Revision 1.0.0 binary
     installation media  on your  system, perform the following
     procedures:


     Restore the Files to Disk

     Mount the installation medium on the appropriate unit

          TSM>A3 IN=DEVMNC,SCRA,U
          TSM>A2 SLO=SYC

     Invoke the  File Manager  and  ensure  that  the  tape  is
     positioned by rewinding the tape

          TSM>FILEMGR
          FIL>REWIND IN

     Skip the first image which contains this SRN file

          FIL>SKIPFILE IN,1

     Restore the On-line Documentation Files

          FIL>RESTORE

     Restore the Compiler Programs, Utilities and Command Files

          FIL>RESTORE

     Restore the Include Files

          FIL>RESTORE

     Restore the C Runtime Library

          FIL>RESTORE

     Restore the Skeleton Parser Driver

          FIL>RESTORE

     Optionally, Restore the Sample C Code and Programs

          FIL>RESTORE

     Rewind the tape and exit the File Manager

          FIL>REWIND IN
          FIL>EXIT


Software Configuration

     The MPX-32  C Compiler  is ready to run after installation
     is complete.  The documentation files (under username DOC)
     may be viewed by the following:

          TSM>USERNAME DOC
          TSM>cat <xxxx.m
              or
          TSM>cat <^(DOC)xxxx.m
              or
          TSM>cat /system/doc/xxxx.m

     This will display the selected documentation file.

     The SAMPLE  files and  the  source  code  for  the  sample
     programs  should   be  reviewed   to  see   some  of   the
     capabilities of  the MPX-32  C Compiler.  The MAK.SAMP TSM
     macro should  be run  to  see  if  the  compiler  operates
     properly on  your system.  The MK2.SAMP TSM macro compiles
     the sample  programs using  the two  pass version  of  the
     compiler.   The programs  CAT and  FIXER can  be cataloged
     using the TSM macro NBLD as follows:

          TSM>USERNAME SAMPLE
          TSM>NBLD cat catmap

     This will catalog the program CAT in the SYSTEM directory.

          TSM>USERNAME SAMPLE
          TSM>NBLD fixer fixermap

     This  will   catalog  the  program  FIXER  in  the  SYSTEM
     directory.

     If the  pathname version of COMPRESS is not available, the
     object modules must be present in the SYSTEM directory.


6 PRODUCT HINTS
____________________________________________________________


General Hints

     The NBLD  macro should  be modified  when several programs
     are to  be combined  to form a load module.  Add the names
     of the  object files  that are  to be  included after  the
     COMPRESS directive.   This  will combine  all of  the non-
     runtime library objects for cataloging.

     The default  startup code  is C.SRTE.O.   It allocates the
     stack and I/O area in extended memory starting at 0x80000.
     The program  will be  started in  extended mode.  If it is
     desirable to  run in  non-extended mode, the object module
     C.SRT.O should be included to allow the program to startup
     in non-extended mode.  This would usually be the case when
     interfacing to FORTRAN subroutines.

     The source  code for  C.SRT.C and  C.SRTE.C are  included.
     These are  the non-extended  and extended mode versions of
     the startup  code.  They assume a 12KW stack.  If a larger
     or smaller  stack is  desired, modify  these programs  for
     your specific needs.

     The source  code for  FCALL.S is  also included.   Due  to
     variations in  Fortran  calling  conventions,  it  may  be
     necessary to modify this interface subroutine.

     The C runtime library is implemented using the UNIX System
     V interface.   Consult  any System  V reference manual for
     calling conventions.  Also, review the include files under
     the username CINCLUDE.

     The load module, NBYACC, is include with the C Compiler as
     an unsupported  utility.   It may or may not be removed in
     future releases  of this  product.    No  Problem  Reports
     (PR's) will be accepted for this utility.

     The MPX-32  C Compiler  and Runtime library are compatible
     with TXPM.   They  will run  as  TXPM  tasks  without  any
     problems.


7 KNOWN PROBLEMS
____________________________________________________________


List of Current Problems

     The one-pass  version of the MPX-32 C Compiler, NBCCOM, is
     quite large  and may  not run on systems with limited task
     execution space.   If  this is the case, use the -2 option
     to NBCC to invoke the two-pass version of the compiler.

     There is minimal documentation.

     The MPX-32  C Compiler  Driver, NBCC,  will not be able to
     invoke the  various  passes  of  the  C  Compiler  if  the
     assigned terminal  is not  a shared  device.   This can be
     corrected by SYSGENing the terminals as shared or patching
     the UDT's  for the  terminals to  set the  shared bit.  If
     neither of  these alternatives are acceptable, the various
     C Compiler  passes will have to be invoked  manually.  The
     following TSM commands can be  used to compile a C program
     named file.c:

          TSM>NBCPP file.c file.i -DMPX -DMPX1X
          TSM>NBCCOM file.i file.z -Xl -XF file
          TSM>NBCAS -G -1 -X -Lfile.l -Ofile.o file.z

              or for two-pass operation

          TSM>NBCPP file.c file.i -DMPX -DMPX1X
          TSM>NBCP1 file.i file.a -Xl -XF file
          TSM>NBCP2 file.a file.z -X2l
          TSM>NBCAS -G -1 -X -Lfile.l -Ofile.o file.z

     See the  documentation files  under  username  DOC  for  a
     description of the various options.

Introduction

     You can check on the status of any MPX-32 software Problem
     Report (PR)  by logging  on to a system at Encore Computer
     Corporation  in   Fort  Lauderdale.   This  procedure   is
     discussed in the section, ONLINE VIEWING OF PRs.

     To learn  how to  report new  problems with  the MPX-32  C
     Compiler, Revision 1.0.0, software and documents, refer to
     the section, PROBLEM REPORTING.

     There are no outstanding PRs for the Revision 1.0.0 of the
     MPX-32 C Compiler.


On-line Viewing of Problem Reports

     Encore Computer Corporation Customer Services maintains an
     problem-report database  for Service Program customers. If
     you are  a Service Program customer, use a modem to log on
     to a  UTX/32 system at Encore Computer Corporation in Fort
     Lauderdale. Dial  (305) 797-5837 and log in as cstspr.  Be
     sure the modem is set to:

          1200 baud

          Full duplex

          8-bit characters

          One stop bit

          No parity

     Call 1-800-TECHAID to report any difficulties with the on-
     line database.


Problem Reporting

     There are  two ways  to report  problems with the MPX-32 C
     Compiler, Revision 1.0.0, software and documentation.

          call the toll-free telephone number

          fill out a PR form.

     The following sections give more information on the use of
     these methods.
