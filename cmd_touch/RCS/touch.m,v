     TOUCH(C)		       UNIX System V		      TOUCH(C)
 
 
     Name
	  touch	- Updates access and modification times	of a file.
 
     Syntax
	  touch	[ -amc ] [ mmddhhmm[yy]	] files
 
     Description
	  touch	causes the access and modification times of each
	  argument to be updated.  If no time is specified (see
	  date(C)) the current time is used.  The first	mm refers to
	  the month, dd	refers to the day, hh refers to	the hour, the
	  second mm refers to the minute, and yy refers	to the year.
	  The -a and -m	options	cause touch to update only the access
	  or modification times	respectively (default is -am).	The -c
	  option silently prevents touch from creating the file	if it
	  did not previously exist.
 
	  The return code from touch is	the number of files for	which
	  the times could not be successfully modified (including
	  files	that did not exist and were not	created).
