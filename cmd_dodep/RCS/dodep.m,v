     Syntax
          dodep makefile filenames ...

     Description

          on the file list.  NBCPP is called with the -M option for
          each file specified.  Any existing dependencies are
          deleted before updating the makefile.

     Notes

          Only files ending in .h, .c, or .s are processed.
