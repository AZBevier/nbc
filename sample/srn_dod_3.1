5 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
____________________________________________________________


Binary Installation

    If the DoD Protocols have already been installed on the
    system, the file D.DODIT should be saved to protect it
    from being overwritten by the file on this tape.

    If ACX-32 is currently installed on the system, the
    object module ON.NOT should be saved before restoring
    the installation tape. The ACX-32 version of ON.NOT must
    be used for both protocols.  To add MPX-32 DoD Protocols
    to the system, first install it by restoring the
    appropriate files from the installation tape.

    To install the MPX-32 DoD Protocols, Revision 3.1,
    binary installation media on your system, perform the
    following procedures:


    1. Restore the files to disk:

       A. Mount the installation medium on the appropriate unit.

              TSM>AS TAP TO DEV=DEVMNC BLOC=N

       B. Invoke the Volume Manager and ensure tape positioning
          by rewinding the tape.

              TSM>VOLMGR
              VOL>REWIND

       C. Skip the first image which contains this SRN file.

              VOL>SKIP I

       D. Restore the DoD Protocols files.

              VOL>RESTORE VOLUME=SYSTEM

       E. Restore DoD system object modules.

              VOL>RESTORE VOLUME=SYSTEM

       F. If desired, restore the demonstration files.

              VOL>RESTORE VOLUME=SYSTEM

       G. Rewind the tape and exit the Volume Manager.

              VOL>REWIND
              VOL>EXIT


Software Configuration

    Perform the installation of the necessary system
    modules.  Read the Network Administrator's guide for
    details of the installation procedure before attempting
    the installation of MPX-32 DoD Protocols.


    + Modify the MPX-32 COMPRESS input file.

    + Perform a COMPRESS.

    + Modify the MPX-32 SYSGEN directives.

    + Perform a SYSGEN.

    + Restart the system.

    + Modify the DoD Protocols control file 'D.DODIT'

    + Create the network tables file 'D.NETAB' (via DNETOP).

    + Run the DoD Protocol activator task 'X.DODIT'. This
      activates the required DoD Protocols tasks. The task
      'X.DODIT' correctly activates the DoD Protocol tasks
      only when it is run by ownername 'SYSTEM'.

6 PRODUCT HINTS
____________________________________________________________


General Hints


    + The TELNET escape character declared in the file
      D.DODIT must be alphabetic. Non-alphabetic characters
      may be used by entering their ASCII values.

      EXAMPLE:  TESC  5D    # ASCII VALUE FOR "]"

    + FTP now checks for project as well as owner rights
      when transferring a file. Files previously transferred
      may now be denied. Non-shared files are denied.

    + During DOD 3.1 initialize, an error code can occur in
      the form of DMXX (where XX is a number). The error
      indicates a partition INCLUDE error. The number can be
      interpreted by referring to the M.INCLUDE service in
      the MPX-32 Reference Manual, Volume I.

    + A restart failure can occur if the DoD Protocols are
      active.  If this problem occurs, it is recommended
      that IP be placed on hold (!HOLD T,IP) or killed
      (!KILL T,IP) before performing the restart.

    + If the TELNET task must be deleted for any reason, use
      the OPCOM "ABORT" command and not the "KILL", or the
      terminal echo and page feature may be lost. This can
      be corrected by logging off and initializing (INIT)
      the terminal.

    + In this release of the product, the interactive task
      DNETOP and its generated output file D.NETAB replaces
      the file D.DHOST for defining the network configuration.

    + The Ethernet handler that was previously bundled into
      Rev. 2.0 of this product is now not included in
      Revision 3.1 of the DoD Protocols. You must ensure
      that you have the latest revision of the handler
      already installed on your system before attempting to
      use these protocols.

    + The Ethernet handler and controller together provide
      the lower two layers (physical and data-link) of
      protocol required by this product. The physical layer
      can be configured either to meet IEEE 802.3 OR
      XEROX/Ethernet specifications. The choice of
      configurations are determined by:

      A) The jumpering on the controller backplane card (DI)
      B) The transceiver cable
      C) The transceiver

    + The network you intend to connect to dictates the
      choice of physical specifications.

      The data-link layer specifications are determined by
      the mode you select for the Ethernet controller. The
      modes supported are 1, 2, and 3. The modes are
      selected by a set of jumpers on the controller board.
      Modes 1 and 2 support XEROX Ethernet specifications
      1.0 AND 2.0. Mode 3 provides for IEEE 802.3 support.
      The following modes define the data encapsulation method:


              MODE 1 AND 2
                 DEST. ADDR | SRCE. ADDR | TYPE CODE | DATA

              MODE 3
                 DEST. ADDR | SRCE. ADDR | LENGTH CNT | DATA


    + X.DODIT performs the same Ethernet controller
      initialization as ENETOP in the product Comm-32
      Ethernet 2.1. Any Ethernet controller used by MPX-32
      DoD Protocols 3.1 does not need to be initialized by
      ENETOP and its data file D.INIT.

    + The data-link and physical layers are independent in
      that the choice of physical layer configuration does
      not require a matching data-link mode selection. You
      only need ascertain that the peer-to-peer protocol
      layers of your system are compatible with those of
      others on the network.

    + Each TPHL entry in the D.DODIT file supports up to
      eight TELNET servers for remote logins to your host.
      Additional servers may be added by introducing extra
      TPHL entries (with unique subchannel addresses).

    + When using FTP, please note that the command line
      feature system only if your user name is in upper
      case. This is a problem with TSM converting lower to
      upper case before passing the command-line arguments
      to the task being activated.

    + To identify the user in FTP, the 'LOGIN' directive on
      MPX is the same as 'USER' on UNIX.

    + To transfer a work file using FTP, the file name must
      be preceded by two single quotes and terminated with a
      single quote. MPX syntax requires the single quote,
      and the single quote also is significant to FTP
      interactive.

      EXAMPLE:  GET ''JS*WRKFL'

    + FTP cannot transfer static memory partitions. If this
      is attempted, FTP or FTPS aborts with error IO17.

    + FTP cannot append to a file that has already reached
      its maximum size. FTP or FTPS will abort with error
      IO17. There is an outstanding PR on MPX for this
      problem.

    + TFTP is not aware of the user's login and, therefore,
      its access rights. To PUT a file using TFTP, "OTHER"
      must have complete privileges or the file is not
      written.

    + UDP can broadcast frames. This is accomplished by
      entering (via DNETOP) 'FFFFFFFFFFFF' as the local
      network address for a host in the D.NETAB file.

    + There was a PR that noted that some UNIX-to-MPX FTP
      ASCII file transfers sometimes truncated the file.
      This has been closed in MPX-32 DoD Protocols 3.0. You
      must have UTX/32 2.0U06 or later installed.

    + When using TELNET and you are intending to use a
      UTX/32 machine as an intermediate node(s), you must
      have UTX/32 2.0U03 or later installed. Perform the
      following modifications to the TELNETD server daemon
      on the UTX/32 machine for your TELNET session to
      function correctly.

      When there is no active telnetd, do the following as
      superuser:


      cd /the_directory_that_telnetd_is_in
      abd -w telnetd
      telnet_with_bridge_box?w 1


    + When you SYSGEN in the pseudo handler on a system with
      multiple IOPs, you can use any IOP channel address,
      but the subchannel address must be unique.

    + Terminals that use TELNET must not have write flow
      control, "WXON". The entry must be deleted from the
      LOGONFLE and the system must be rebooted to remove the
      control.

    + IF ACX-32 is to be installed on the same system as the
      DoD protocols, the ACX-32 module name ON.NOT must be
      used rather than the DoD Protocol version of ON.NOT.

List of Current Problems


    + Comm-32 DoD Protocols Programmer's Guide, pg. 5-26.

      Add the following under the status code "0" explanation:

      A return status of 0 (zero) means only that the
      request has passed through the protocol layers to the
      network; it does not imply that the request was
      successfully received by the remote host.

    + When a TCPSEND is issued, a Urgent flag byte is set at
      the beginning of the packet whenever the Urgent flag
      is true; the additional Urgent-flag byte may be seen
      as one more byte of data than was expected. The remote
      application should check for this flag; if it exists,
      the application should perform an additional Read or
      adjust the packet size.

    + Comm-32 Network Administrator's Guide, pg. 5-3.

      Under "TELNET Pseudo-handler", references to "y0"
      should be changed to "x0" (e.g., change U8ccy0 to
      U8ccx0, and change "y0" to "x0" in the text. Also
      change the word "second" in line 7 of the second
      paragraph to read "first".

Online Viewing of Problem Reports

    Encore Computer Corporation Customer Services maintains
    a problem-report database for Service Program customers.
    If you are a Service Program customer, use a modem to
    log on to a UTX/32 system at Encore Computer Corporation
    in Fort Lauderdale. Dial (305) 797-5837 and log in as
    cstspr.  Be sure the modem is set to:

    + 1200 baud

    + Full duplex

    + 8-bit characters

    + One stop bit

    + No parity


    Call 1-800-TECHAID to report any difficulties with the
    online database.
