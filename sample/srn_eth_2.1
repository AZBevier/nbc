    installation media on your system, restore the
    appropriate files from the installation tape, then
    configure your system by creating a new system image
    that incorporates Ethernet.  The installer should be
    familiar with MPX-32 installation and system generation
    procedures.


    A. Installation

       1.Restore the files from a tape drive to the system's disk.

    B. Software Configuration

       1. Modify the MPX-32 COMPRESS directives.
       2. Perform a COMPRESS.
       3. Modify the MPX-32 SYSGEN directives.
       4. Perform a SYSGEN.
       5. Modify the Ethernet control file "D.INIT".
       6. Append "SM.LANMC" and "SR.LANRT" to the MPX-32 Macro Library
          and the MPX-32 Scientific Run-Time Library, respectively.
       7. Restart the system.



Installation Procedure


Restore the Files to Disk


    + Mount the installation medium on the appropriate unit.

      TSM>AS TAP TO DEV=DEVMNC BLOC=N

    + Invoke the Volume Manager and ensure that the tape is
      positioned by rewinding the tape.

      TSM>VOLMGR
      VOL>REWIND

    + Skip the first image which contains this SRN file.

      VOL>SKIP I

    + Restore the Ethernet files.

      VOL>RESTORE VOLUME=SYSTEM

    + If desired, restore the demonstration files and
      examples.

      VOL>RESTORE VOLUME = SYSTEM

    + Rewind the tape and exit the Volume Manager.

      VOL>REWIND
      VOL>EXIT



Software Configuration

    The COMPRESS input file must be updated to include the
    object module "ON.ENXIO" and "ON.ENIF". A starter
    COMPRESS directives file is provided on the MPX-32
    master SDT tape and is originally named as follows:


                                To be used
    COMPRESS Input File      with machine type
    -------------------      -----------------
            JH.32            Any CONCEPT machine with MPX-32
                             3.4U03 or above operating system



    Note:  When operating in the mapped-out mode on a
           CONCEPT 32/2000, the JH.32_OUT file must be
           modified.

    Enter the following commands in response to the TSM prompt:

    TSM>EDIT XX

          Where XX is a work-file code

    EDT>USE JH.32

    EDT>CR

          Where CR is a carriage return



    The COMPRESS input file is now displayed. Add file names
    "ON.ENXIO", and "ON.ENIF" immediately in front of the
    system allocation module named "OH.GPMCS" by using the
    editor as follows:


    EDT>COL XX.X

              Where,

                  XX.X      is the line number to collect
                  ON.ENXIO  Ethernet handler
                  ON.ENIF   Ethernet interrupt fielder

    EDT>STORE JH.32 UNN   Store into an Ethernet COMPRESS input file
    EDT>EXIT              Exit editor


Perform a COMPRESS


    To perform a COMPRESS, run the following TSM macro:

    TSM>MN.CMPR JH.32 ON.32

            OR

    TSM>MN.CMPR JH.32_OUT ON.32_OUT (For CONCEPT 32/2000 mapped-out operation)


    The system object modules are copied to the "ON.32" or
    "ON.32_OUT" object input files and are displayed on the
    terminal.

Modify the SYSGEN directives


    The following MPX-32 SYSGEN directives are used when
    configuring Ethernet software:

                           CONTROLLER
                             DEVICE
                              POOL
                            SEQUENCE

Controller


    Each //HARDWARE section controller directive you supply
    to the SYSGEN directive file configures an MPX Ethernet
    controller.  Note that the maximum configuration is four
    controllers per system.

    Syntax -

    CONTROLLER=TTCC,PRIORITY=INTLEV,CLASS=F,MUX=XIO,HANDLER=(N.ENIF,I)


    Where,


          TT       is the two-character ASCII device code
                        (CA =  communication adapter)
          CC       is the two hexadecimal digit channel number
          INTLEV   is the two hexadecimal digit interrupt level
          F        Extended I/O (device class)
          XIO      Extended I/O device.
          N.ENIF   XIO interrupt fielder name.
          I        Interrupt level reentrancy designator.


Device


    The //HARDWARE section device directives further define
    the Ethernet controller by designating "N.ENXIO" as the
    device handler. Note that the option "SHR" must be
    specified here to run a statistics logging utility.

    Syntax -

    DEVICE=(00,A,L),[DTC=TT],HANDLER=N.ENXIO [,SHR]

    Where,


          00       is the two hexadecimal digit device subaddress
          A        is an optional parameter specifying the decimal
                   number of devices starting at the subaddress
          L        is an optional parameter specifying the hexadecimal
                   address increment for each additional device
          TT       is the optional two-character device mnemonic
                        (CA =  COMMUNICATION ADAPTER)
          N.ENXIO  Seven-character Ethernet handler name
          SHR      Allows the device to be shared



Sequence

    The //SOFTWARE section sequence directive specifies the
    names of load modules that are activated after booting
    the system. The network initializer task, "ENETOP", can
    be included with this directive. If you want MPX
    Ethernet to be initialized automatically after your
    system is booted, add this directive at the end of the
    /PARAMETERS subsection of the SYSGEN list.

    Syntax -

    SEQUENCE=(ENETOP)

    Where,


          ENETOP  -  Initializes the Ethernet controller.



Perform a SYSGEN

    To perform a SYSGEN, run the following macro:

    TSM>MN.GEN [YOURDIR] [??]

    Where YOURDIR is the file name of your SYSGEN directives
    and ?? reflects the machine type.

    Note:  Your SYSGEN directives must assign Logical File
           Code OBJ to the COMPRESS output files ON.32 or
           ON.32_OUT.


Sample SYSGEN Directive File

    A sample SYSGEN directive file is shown below.

Modify the Ethernet D.INIT Control File


    D.INIT is used by the network initialization task named
    ENETOP.  It is stored as a system file under the
    reserved name "D.INIT".  D.INIT provides the parameters
    necessary to initialize the controller.

    When MPX Ethernet is installed on your host computer, a
    starter copy of this file is placed in the SYSTEM
    directory.  If you use a text editor to retrieve this
    file, it looks like this:


    XX               Controller Address (Channel Address)
    N                Mode (Ethernet 1=1; Ethernet 2=2; IEEE 802.3=3)
    XXXXXXXXXXXX     Physical/Local Address (12 hex numbers)
    AAA              Addressing Mode - Promiscuous (On/Off)
    AAA              Multicast Mode (On/Off)
    XXXXXXXXXXXX     Multicast Addresses (12 hex numbers each)


    Using the editor, replace the letters with the items
    that are appropriate to your system. For more
    information, please see chapter three of the software
    manual.


Modify the MPX-32 Macro Library and SRTL


    Note:  The Scientific Run-Time Library must be at
           Revision level 5.0 or higher.


MPX-32 Macro Library

    The Ethernet macro file "SM.LANMC" is appended to MPX-32
    macro library by submitting the following TSM job
    stream.

    TSM>SUBMIT JM.LANMC

    Note:  First time installation causes the macro
           librarian to abort because it is trying to delete
           non-existent macros.  This abort message should
           be followed by a message stating that the macros
           have been successfully installed. Ignore the
           first abort message if the second message
           appears.

Scientific Run-Time Library

    The Ethernet runtime file, "SR.LANRT", is added to the
    MPX-32 native mode Scientific Run-Time LIBRARY by
    submitting the following TSM job stream.

    TSM>SUBMIT JR.LANRT SRTL SRTD

    Note:  Be sure to install the Ethernet Macro Library
           before you install the Ethernet Scientific Run-
           Time Library.


    Note:  SRTL and SRTD are the library and directory
           names, respectively. If not supplied, SRTL and
           SRTD defaults to SRTL50N and SRTD50N.


Restart The System

    If the Ethernet configuration is going to run on the
    system which it was built on, the following restart
    procedure can be used:

    TSM>RESTART [????????]

        Where ???????? is the name of the system into
        which Ethernet was SYSGEN'd.


    The system responds:


    DO YOU WISH TO RESTART? (Y OR N):


    A "Y" response brings up the system containing Ethernet.


    Ethernet is ready for use once ENETOP has run. If the
    MPX-32 SYSGEN directive is used to run "ENETOP"
    automatically, (SEQUENCE=ENETOP ) then Ethernet is ready
    for use immediately after the system boots up.


6 PRODUCT HINTS
____________________________________________________________


General Hints

    + Under certain conditions during heavy use, the
      Ethernet controller has a tendency to give priority to
      some logical subchannels; this tendency occurs under
      conditions in which Comm-32 Ethernet continuously
      queues frames for transmission without letup. The
      conditions are abnormal and are unlikely to occur
      during an Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 network's normal
      operation.

      The described tendency can only occur if you have
      assigned more than two logical subchannels for
      transmitting frames.  Under the heavy loading of
      continuous transmit requests, the controller services
      requests for the two (transmitting) subchannels that
      have the lowest numbers, to the exclusion of the other
      subchannels. Logical subchannels are numbered 0
      through 15.  Transmit requests queued for the higher
      number subchannels time out, causing frequent
      malfunction resets; this results in significantly
      reduced efficiency.

      If your implementation requires the kind of heavy
      transmitting capability described here, you can avoid
      the problem by queuing transmit requests on only two
      logical subchannels.

    + Multiple subchannel use of NOWAIT I/O increases the
      demand on memory pool space. If the pool size is
      inadequate for your I/O usage, a timeout can occur
      causing an automatic malfunction reset.

8 PROBLEM REPORT SUMMARY
____________________________________________________________


Introduction

    You can check on the status of any Comm-32 software
    Problem Report (PR) by logging on to a system at Encore
    Computer Corporation in Fort Lauderdale. This procedure
    is discussed in the section, ONLINE VIEWING OF PRs.

    To learn how to report new problems with Comm-32 Ethernet,
    Revision 2.1, software and documents, refer to the
    section, PROBLEM REPORTING.

    The following PRs have been addressed in Revision 2.1 of
    Comm-32 Ethernet:


              87001687
              90000083
              90000095



Online Viewing of Problem Reports

    Encore Computer Corporation Customer Services maintains
    an problem-report database for Service Program customers.
    If you are a Service Program customer, use a modem to
    log on to a UTX/32 system at Encore Computer Corporation
    in Fort Lauderdale. Dial (305) 797-5837 and log in as cstspr.
    Be sure the modem is set to:

    + 1200 baud

    + Full duplex

    + 8-bit characters

    + One stop bit

    + No parity


    Call 1-800-TECHAID to report any difficulties with the
    online database.


Problem Reporting

    There are two ways to report problems with Comm-32 Ethernet,
    Revision 2.1, software and documentation.

    + call the toll-free telephone number

    + fill out a PR form.


    The following sections give more information on the use
    of these methods.

By Telephone

    To report a software or documentation problem by telephone,
    within the USA., call a customer service representative at
    1-800-TECHAID. You will be asked to provide the following
    information:
