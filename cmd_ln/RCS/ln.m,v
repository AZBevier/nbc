     Name
	  ln  -	 Makes a link to a file.
 
     Syntax
	  ln file1 file2
	  ln file1 ... directory
 
     Description
	  A link is a directory	entry referring	to a file; the same
	  file (together with its size,	all its	protection
	  information, etc).  may have several links to	it.  There is
	  no way to distinguish	a link to a file from its original
	  directory entry.  Any	changes	to the file are	effective
	  independent of the name by which the file is known.
 
	  In the first case, ln	creates	a link to the existing file,
	  file1.  The file2 argument is	a new name referring to	the
	  same file contents as	file1.
 
	  In the second	case, directory	is the location	of a directory
	  into which one or more links are created with	corresponding
	  file names.
 
	  You cannot link to a directory or link across	file systems.
