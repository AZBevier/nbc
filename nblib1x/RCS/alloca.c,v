	alloca -- (mostly) portable public-domain implementation

	last edit:	86/01/26	D A Gwyn

	This implementation of the PWB library alloca() function,
	which is used to allocate space off the run-time stack so
	that it is automatically reclaimed upon procedure exit,
	was inspired by discussions with J. Q. Johnson of Cornell.

	It should work under any C implementation that uses an
	actual procedure stack (as opposed to a linked list of
	frames).  There are some preprocessor constants that can
	be defined when compiling for your specific system, for
	improved efficiency; however, the defaults should be okay.

	The general concept of this implementation is to keep
	track of all alloca()-allocated blocks, and reclaim any
	that are found to be deeper in the stack than the current
	invocation.  This heuristic does not reclaim storage as
	soon as it becomes invalid, but it will do so eventually.

	As a special case, alloca(0) reclaims storage without
	allocating any.  It is a good idea to use alloca(0) in
	your main control loop, etc. to force garbage collection.
