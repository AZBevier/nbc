/* this module supplies a full set of routines to implement arithmetic
   on the compiler internal format for floating point numbers.  This
   form provides for a decimal exponent of two bytes (+-32768) and
   a mantissa of N bytes, which is in the form of an integer such that
   it is prime mod 10.  That is, trailing zeroes have been deleted.
   nf[0] is the least significant byte of the mantissa.

   Mathematically, if the exponent is ne and the fraction is nf. The
   value of the number is nf * 10**ne.

   There are two classes of routines:  those that operate on structures
   (denoted by the letter 'f') and those that work on arrays of characters
   (denoted by the letter 's').  Arguments to the latter are of the
   form ( (char *), int ), for the start and length respectively.

   There are a few routines that are hybrid, and utilize an immediate
   constant (denoted 'k'), hence:

	addff( f1,f2 )		adds the structure *f1 to *f2
	addfs( f1, sp, sl )	adds the byte string *sp to *f1
	addfk( f1, k )		adds k to *f1

   Predicates follow the same convention.
