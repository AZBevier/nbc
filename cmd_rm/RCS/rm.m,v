     Name
	  rm, rmdir  - Removes files or	directories.
 
     Syntax
	  rm [ -fri ] file ...
 
	  rmdir	dir ...
 
     Description
	  rm removes the entries for one or more files from a
	  directory.  If an entry was the last link to the file, the
	  file is destroyed.  Removal of a file	requires write
	  permission in	its directory, but neither read	nor write
	  permission on	the file itself.
 
	  If a file has	no write permission and	the standard input is
	  a terminal, its permissions are printed and a	line is	read
	  from the standard input.  If that line begins	with y,	the
	  file is deleted, otherwise the file remains.	No questions
	  are asked when the -f	option is given	or if the standard
	  input	is not a terminal.
 
	  If a designated file is a directory, an error	comment	is
	  printed unless the optional argument -r has been used.  In
	  that case, rm	recursively deletes the	entire contents	of the
	  specified directory, and the directory itself.
 
	  If the -i (interactive) option is in effect, rm asks whether
	  to delete each file, and if the -r option is in effect,
	  whether to examine each directory.
 
	  The special option ``--'' can	be used	to delimit options.
	  For example, a file named ``-f'' could not be	removed	by rm
	  because the hyphen is	interpreted as an option; the command
	  rm -f	would do nothing, since	no file	is specified.  Using
	  rm --	-f removes the file successfully.
 
	  rmdir	removes	empty directories.

     Diagnostics
	  Generally self-explanatory.  It is forbidden to remove the
	  file .. to avoid the consequences of inadvertently doing
	  something like:
 
	       rm -r .*
 
	  It is	also forbidden to remove the root directory of a given
	  file system.

	  No more than 17 levels of subdirectories can be removed
	  using	the -r option.
