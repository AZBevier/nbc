     Syntax
	  cmprs -I namelist -O ofile names ...
 
     Description

    	  for SGO input.
 
	  The -I option is used to specify a file that contains a list of
    	  filenames that are to concatinated.  If not specified, the filename
    	  list is taken from the command line.
 
    	  The -O option specifies an output file to place the concatinated

    	  stdout.  If the specified file is not present, the file is

	  may be put in	the output file twice.
